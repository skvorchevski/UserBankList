scripts in file to put in git. To check up working (using select to deduce each field on
time)
DataBase contain two tables:
User(userId INT, name VARCHAR(45),sureName VARCHAR(45));
Account(accountId INT,  account INT, userId INT)
Create DAO with JDBC to get data from Data Base. Using JDBC, implement methods
for returning from the user's data table by its id, and also the method for returning all
accounts (the data will be written to the List).
Create Service and Servlet to send data to view. 
Writes JUnit Tests to check “business logic”.
Writes JSP to view. Write two fields and two buttons for displaying the richest user
and for the sum of all the accounts in the bank (use JSP).
